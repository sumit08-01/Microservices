#commant all the properties accept service-name, because all the properies are comming from the config-server.

#properties form config-server.

#SO this is the property we need to set that look for the config-server using service-discovery, in our case eureka
#  cloud:
#    config:
#      discovery:
#        enabled: true
#        service-id: config-server #look for the config-server.
##      uri: http://localhost:8888 # this will used when you are not using Eureka as a discovery client. and above two properties using when your as using eureka as a discovery-clinet.

#At the end you have to change the file name of you application.yml to bootstrap.yml in the address-service.
#you have to change every properties file name where ever you are usign config-clinet and bootstrap dependency
